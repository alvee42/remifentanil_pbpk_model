# remifentanil_pbpk_model

BMES 611 - Biological Control Systems Term Project. 

Group Project: Alvee Hoque and Kah Young 

Objective: Create a biological control system model or obtain an already available model and adjust it. 

We found equations for a Pharmacokinetics model on remifentanil from Cascone et al, 2013 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3829787/). 
The ODEs from the paper were used to create our model. Our modification was to change clearance and volume rates so it can be used on elderly patient profiles.
