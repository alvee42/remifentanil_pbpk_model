# remifentanil_pbpk_model

BMES 611 - Biological Control Systems Term Project. 
Group Project: Alvee Hoque and Kah Young 

Objective: Create a biological control system model or obtain an already available model and adjust it. 

We found a model on remifentanil from Cascone et al, 2013 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3829787/). 
The ODEs from the paper were used to create our model and then we adjusted it for elderly patients.
